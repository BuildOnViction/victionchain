## About TomoChain

TomoChain is an innovative solution to the scalability problem with the Ethereum blockchain.
Our mission is to be a leading force in building the Internet of Value, and its infrastructure.
We are working to create an alternative, scalable financial system which is more secure, transparent, efficient, inclusive, and equitable for everyone.

TomoChain relies on a system of 150 Masternodes with a Proof of Stake Voting consensus that can support near-zero fee, and 2-second transaction confirmation times.
Security, stability, and chain finality are guaranteed via novel techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts, and "true" randomization processes.

Tomochain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers.
New scaling techniques such as sharding, private-chain generation, and hardware integration will be continuously researched and incorporated into Tomochain's masternode architecture. This architecture will be an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuances, and token integrations for small and big businesses.

More details can be found at our [technical white paper](https://tomochain.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/technical-whitepaper-1.0.pdf)

## Building the source

Tomochain provides a client binary called `tomo` for both running a masternode and running a full-node.
Building `tomo` requires both a Go (1.7+) and C compiler; install both of these.

Once the dependencies are installed, just run the below commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tomochain/tomochain tomochain
$ cd tomochain
$ make tomo
```

Alternatively, you could quickly download our pre-complied binary from our [github release page](https://github.com/tomochain/tomochain/releases)

## Running `tomo`

### Running a tomo masternode

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.tomochain.com/get-started/run-node/) on how to run a node if your goal is to run a masternode.
The recommanded ways of running a node and applying to become a masternode are explained in detail there.

### Attaching to the Tomochain test network

We published our test network 2.0 with full implementation of PoSV consensus at https://stats.testnet.tomochain.com.
If you'd like to experiment with smart contract creation and DApps, you might be interested to give these a try on our Testnet.

In order to connect to one of the masternodes on the Testnet, just run the command below:

```bash
$ tomo attach https://rpc.testnet.tomochain.com
```

This will open the JavaScript console and let you query the blockchain directly via RPC.

### Running `tomo` locally

#### Download genesis block
$GENESIS_PATH : location of genesis file you would like to put
```bash
export GENESIS_PATH=path/to/genesis.json
```
- Testnet
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomochain/tomochain/master/genesis/testnet.json -o $GENESIS_PATH
```

- Mainnet
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomochain/tomochain/master/genesis/mainnet.json -o $GENESIS_PATH
```

#### Create datadir
- create a folder to store tomochain data on your machine

```bash
export DATA_DIR=/path/to/your/data/folder 
mkdir -p $DATA_DIR/tomo
```
#### Initialize the chain from genesis

```bash
tomo init $GENESIS_PATH --datadir $DATA_DIR
```

#### Initialize / Import accounts for the nodes's keystore
If you already had an existing account, import it. Otherwise, please initialize new accounts 

```bash
export KEYSTORE_DIR=path/to/keystore
```

##### Initialize new accounts
```bash
tomo account new \
  --password [YOUR_PASSWORD_FILE_TO_LOCK_YOUR_ACCOUNT] \
  --keystore $KEYSTORE_DIR
```
    
##### Import accounts
```bash
tomo  account import [PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_OF_YOUR_ACCOUNT] \
     --keystore $KEYSTORE_DIR \
     --password [YOUR_PASSWORD_FILE_TO_LOCK_YOUR_ACCOUNT]
```

##### List all available accounts in keystore folder

```bash
tomo account list --datadir ./  --keystore $KEYSTORE_DIR
```

#### Start a node
##### Environment variables
   - $IDENTITY: the name of your node
   - $PASSWORD: the password file to unlock your account
   - $YOUR_COINBASE_ADDRESS: address of your account which generated in the previous step
   - $NETWORK_ID: the networkId. Mainnet: 88. Testnet: 89
   - $BOOTNODES: The comma separated list of bootnodes. Find them [here](https://docs.tomochain.com/general/networks/)
   - $WS_SECRET: The password to send data to the stats website. Find them [here](https://docs.tomochain.com/general/networks/)
   - $NETSTATS_HOST: The stats website to report to, regarding to your environment. Find them [here](https://docs.tomochain.com/general/networks/)
   - $NETSTATS_PORT: The port used by the stats website (usually 443)
    
##### Let's start a node
```bash
tomo  --syncmode "full" \    
    --datadir $DATA_DIR --networkid $NETWORK_ID --port 30303 \   
    --keystore $KEYSTORE_DIR --password $PASSWORD \    
    --rpc --rpccorsdomain "*" --rpcaddr 0.0.0.0 --rpcport 8545 --rpcvhosts "*" \   
    --rpcapi "db,eth,net,web3,personal,debug" \    
    --gcmode "archive" \   
    --ws --wsaddr 0.0.0.0 --wsport 8546 --wsorigins "*" --unlock "$YOUR_COINBASE_ADDRESS" \   
    --identity $IDENTITY \  
    --mine --gasprice 2500 \  
    --bootnodes $BOOTNODES \   
    --ethstats $IDENTITY:$WS_SECRET@$NETSTATS_HOST:$NETSTATS_PORT 
    console
```
